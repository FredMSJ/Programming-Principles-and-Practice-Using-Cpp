Section 4 exercise 4 debug is to try all iterations of possible guesses.
A program to play a numbers guessing game.
The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and your program asks questions to figure out what the number is
(e.g., "Is the number you are thinking of less than 50?").
Your program should be able to identify the number after asking no more than seven questions.
Hint: Use the < and <= operators and the if-else construct.
