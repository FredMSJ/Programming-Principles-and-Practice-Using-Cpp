/*
Section 3 exercise 8.
A program to test an integer value to determine if it is odd or even.
As always, make sure your output is clear and complete.
In other words, donâ€™t just output yes or no. Your output should stand alone,
like The value 4 is an even number. Hint: See the remainder (modulo) operator in section 3.4.
